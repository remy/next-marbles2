# Marbles Squared for the ZX Spectrum Next

Clear the board. Get the high score. The first Spectrum Next game with an online leader board.

## Game play

The aim is to clear the board of "marbles" - the blocks, and reach the highest score possible.

Scoring is the number of blocks (n) times n+1, so 2 blocks gets 6 points, 3 blocks get 12 points, and so on.

Completely clearing the board gets you a level up and a bonus 250 points.

Each game has a unique "seed", and once a seed is used you will see the exact same arrangement of boards on every level you complete.

Use the high score tables to find a game seed and challenge an existing high score.

Important keyboard keys to use:

- [R] rage quit and restart
- [N] new game and new seed
- [U] undo your dreadful mistakes

Remember to check the world leader board for a *real* challenge.

## A brief history

Marbles Squared began as a Palm Pilot game back in the early 2000s and amassed some 250,000 downloads.

The title mixes at random between _Marbles Squared_, _MarblesÂ²_ and _Marbles2_ - but the "Squared" was simply because Remy couldn't draw circles, and "Marbles" because he had unwittingly cloned SameGame on the Psion.

## Sharing your score

If your Spectrum is equipped with a wifi connection then in normal operation, the game will self-submit your high scores to the leader board.

If, however, you don't have wifi onboard or perhaps the send failed (i.e. you're sure you got a high score) - the `marbles.dat` file in the game directory contains your score. Send this file [remy@remysharp.com](mailto:remy@remysharp.com?subject=marbles%20score) and I will manually validate and submit your score for the world to see.
